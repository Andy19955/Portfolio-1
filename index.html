              Hello! I'm a proud resident of Sarpsborg, practically waving to my neighbors in Sweden from my window. I've swapped out my electrician's tools for textbooks and chalk, and now I'm
              currently shaping young minds as a teacher (okay, maybe whiteboard markers are more popular to use these days and the textbooks have turned digital). My toolkit includes nature science,
              math and music - because who doesn't want to balance equations <em>and</em> play a beautiful piano melody?
            </p>
            <p>
              When I'm not teaching, I'm studying <span class="highlight-text">Front-end development</span> at Noroff Vocational School. Basically, I'm learning how to make the internet look
              <span class="highlight-text">pretty... and functional</span>. So far, I've built 3 websites as student projects. My side projects are usually larger projects because hey, what's better
              than a <span class="highlight-text">good challenge</span> that allows you to learn and feed your knowledge? Whether it's a classrom, a website, or some DIY adventure, I'm all about
              <span class="highlight-text">creating</span>, <span class="highlight-text">learning</span>, and coming up with <span class="highlight-text">new solutions</span> to keep things exciting.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm also a master of <span class="highlight-text">solo missions</span> and <span class="highlight-text">teamwork</span> - so whether you need someone to solve a problem or just someone
              to listen to your "nest big idea", <span class="highlight-text">I'm your guy!</span>
            </p>

                    This is my exam project at Noroff Vocational School. The goal of this project was to demonstrate the skills learned over my first year of studies. I was tasked with creating a blog
                    with a responsive design. The blog should contain at least a home page, an about page, a page with list of blog posts, a post specific page and a contact page. The contact form
                    should have a form validation done in JavaScript. The blog's content should be stored on WordPress, installed as a headless CMS, and fetched via the WordPress REST API. The post
                    specific page had to be able to dynamycally display all posts based on their post ID.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For this project I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create the Website. The site should consider WCAG principles and meta tags to improve SEO. GitHub is used for version control
                    and the site is deployed to Netlify. The project also required to install Hotjar for user testing, and a report documenting the choices and process along the way.

                    This project has been used in multiple study modules at Noroff Vocational School, and has been developed more and more. The last module it was used in, Content Management Systems,
                    it should end up as a responsive website displaying different products. The products should be stored in WordPress, installed as a headless CMS, with the WooCommerce plugin
                    installed. By using the WooCommerce API, the product's data should be fetched with JavaScript. The page had to have at least 5 products stored in WooCommerce. The JavaScript should
                    have the functinality to fetch a single product's data and render a grid of product data. There should be one product specific page that should have the ability to dynamically
                    display all products based on their product ID.

                    This is my first semester project at Noroff Vocational School. The goal of this project was to demonstrate the skills learned over my first semester of studies. These skills
                    included design principles, project management, communication technology and development with HTML/CSS. The target audience for this project was set to primary and middle school
                    children (ages 7-15) and families with young children. The website should be responsive, informative, engaging and appealing to attract the target audience to visit the museum. For
                    this project I was provided with media assets such as text and images.
